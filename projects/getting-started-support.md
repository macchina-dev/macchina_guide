# Getting Started Support

## Resources

#### For everyone:&#x20;

* **Wiring diagrams:** Many car specific questions can be answered by looking at wiring diagram. Anytime you ask someone for help you should try to include wiring diagrams.  &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
On newer cars where diagrams are often missing you often have to use an older year's diagrams, it's not ideal but it will do in a pinch unless this is the first year of a new generation check the car Wiki page for generation year cut offs
{% endhint %}

* [**r/carhacking**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarHacking/)**:** One of the best places to find like minded car nerds. This subreddit was actually started by Macchina M2 beta testers and has since grown into one of the best automotive electronics communities. With 20k subscribers you are pretty likely to find someone there who has tried to do what you are working on or at least has experience with the car you're working on.&#x20;

#### Developers and Engineers:&#x20;

* **Other documentation:**  For example A0 uses the ESP32-WROVER-E Espressif provides a great support network including documentation and data sheets that will help. Many people develop for A0 with the Arduino IDE, you will find good documentation and resources on their site.&#x20;
* **Macchina Dev Forum:** Lots of good info relevant to developing for Macchina products here. Do a quick search of the forum to see if your question was answered in there. (We know this is not an ideal place to find answers quickly. We are currently trying to move relevant information out of the forum and into the docs. )&#x20;
* [CarHackingVillage:](https://www.carhackingvillage.com/) A group that travels to multiple conferences usually security research and hacking relate. They but on demonstrations, talks, competitions, and training. Great way to get hands on experience and meet knowledgeable people.&#x20;





## How to get help

If you have questions related to Automotive reverse engineering, CAN bus (or other protocols), or building your applications that leverage these technologies, please follow the below process. We want to help as much as possible and this is the best way to work with us and the community to build great projects. &#x20;

General Process: We want you to submit your questions to both us and the Reddit Carhacking community. This way we can try to help in a public searchable place, but also get as many qualified eye balls as possible (in many cases we have no experience with the car you're working on but someone at R/CH will) so you get great answers and hopefully start a good discussion.&#x20;

Step 1: Fill out the below and submit it at [https://www.reddit.com/r/CarHacking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarHacking/)

* Make: (Ford, Toyota,...)&#x20;
* Model/Engine/trim: (Example: F-150, 5.4 V8, King Ranch)&#x20;
* Year: (what year is it!)&#x20;
* Description of your setup: (tools, wiring, include pictures...)
* What are you trying to do: (example: roll my windows up on command, provide detail)
* Context: (where are you stuck, what have you tried)&#x20;
* Relevant wiring diagrams: (I suggest including both the OEM and non OEM diagrams available from All-data. Try to include all the relevant systems computer data lines, DLC, and any target parts like the fuel pump.)&#x20;
* Attachments: relevant wiring diagrams, SavvyCAN logs, specific ECU details when applicable, Arduino or other sketches&#x20;

Step 2: Send us a link to the reddit post to info@macchina.cc, subject: Start Support

We will share the link internally and add anything we can to the discussion. We try hard to provide as much support to these posts as possible.&#x20;
