# Processor

The processor board of M2 contains the brains and the communication circuitry. It features 6 LEDs (5 one-color and 1 RGB LED), 4 switches (2 user switches, RESET and ERASE), an EEPROM, an SD car socket, a Native USB port (that can act as both a USB device or host), and a XBee form factor socket,

M2 uses the same processor as the Arduino Due.
