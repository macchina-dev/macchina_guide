## XBee-compatible socket

M2 has an _XBee-compatible form factor socket_ on the top of the processor board. In other words: two 2mm pitch x 10 pin headers spaced 22mm apart. You an read more about [XBee modules on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBee)

There are LOTs of modules that fit this socket, with many different functions. WiFi, BLE, GSM, LTE, Ethernet, etc.

When connecting a _XBee-compatible form factor socket_ to M2, makes sure that is is oriented so that pin 1 (+3.3V) is at the corner nearest the USB socket as shown here:

## USB

M2 has a USB connector that can act as either a HOST or DEVICE depending on your code.

M2 uses Native USB port only. To print something to the Serial monitor, you'd need to use this command:

```cpp
SerialUSB.print("Something");
```
