  coorespond to signals on the rest of P1.

# Pin Mapping

P1 consists of 3 PCBs all stacked together through headers. Each board has its own schematic and each header and signal may have different names on each board.



![UTH and UTD versions of P1](../../.gitbook/assets/P1\_exploded.JPG)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Caution: Neither PocketBeagle nor Interface board is keyed, so it is possible to plug together incorrectly. Use the above diagram to ensure you are plugging together correctly.

Caution: In the case of UTH version - with enough force, it is possible to plug a 24 pin connector into the 26 pin connector socket. Please don't do that.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

##

P1 boards:

**PocketBeagle** (schematic [here](https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/blob/master/PocketBeagle\_sch.pdf)). This is the brains of the operation.&#x20;

**Adapter board** (schematic [here](https://github.com/macchina/p1-hardware/blob/master/SCH-01010%20R1%20SCHEM.PDF)). This board acts connects PocketBeagle to the M2 interface board, adds a battery connector and full-sized USB A connector.&#x20;

**Interface board** (schematic [here](https://github.com/macchina/m2-hardware/blob/master/M2/Interface%20Board/Interface%20Board%20Schematic.pdf)). This is the same interface board used with M2. This board has all of the automotive interfaces and power supply.&#x20;

## P1 headers:

Headers connect throughout P1 as follows:

| PocketBeagle Headers   | Adapter board headers  | Interface board headers      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **P1**    connects to: | **J5**                 | -                            |
| **P2**   connects to:  | **J6**                 | -                            |
| -                      | **J2**    connects to: | J3                           |
| -                      | **J3**   connects to:  | J4                           |
| -                      | -                      | **J5** (26 pin connector)    |
| -                      | -                      | **J1** (UTD) or **J2** (UTH) |
