## Issues/Returns

### Defective products

We don’t want to ship things that don’t work, so we test every unit before it leaves. That doesn’t mean customers never have issues, but it should be rare. If you are having an issue, please make sure you have eliminated the other possible causes (computer, cable, sd card, or other issues).&#x20;

If you still believe our hardware is the issue please reach out to us at [info@macchina.cc](mailto:info@macchina.cc), subject: Product Defect&#x20;

We will send you a return label and get the replacement processed.

### Broken

Sometimes you let the magic smoke out when trying to build cool things. We have seen people come up with interesting ways of accomplishing that. We like to see what happened.&#x20;

Please email (info@macchina.cc, Subject: Magic Smoke Issue) us pictures of the hardware (especially if you can see an obvious issue) and what you were doing with the hardware, this is mostly for future design planning.&#x20;

Most issues are not worth trying to fix. If we want to inspect the issue ourselves we will send you a return label.&#x20;

If you want to replace the unit we will offer you a one time discount code (unless you make a habit of this).&#x20;



## International orders

We prefer to do international shipping through our resellers. We are willing to ship [bulk orders](contact-us-faq.md#bulk-orders) internationally,

Sparkfun (Worldwide)&#x20;

Digi-Key (US only)&#x20;
