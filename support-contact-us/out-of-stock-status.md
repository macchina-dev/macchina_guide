# Out of Stock/ Status

For those who are curious about our extended out of stock period, the short answer is we got hit by a number of issues all at once. COVID first caused parts shortages, then caused CMs to change strategies, both of which changed our business plans. &#x20;

Once products go to Production Start expect about 10 weeks until they are on shelves.&#x20;

Unfortunately no one in support will be able to offer any more detail than what is available here. &#x20;
